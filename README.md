# Effective Reproduction number of COVID-19 in Bangladesh and spatial clustering of Rt using K-means clustering 

 Effective Reproduction number of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic to August 2021
 
What is the Rt value?

The R value, also known as the reproduction number, describes how many people an infected person infects on average. Together with the number of new infections every day, the time-dependent reproduction number R t is an important measure of how quickly the disease is currently spreading. There are three cases:
Rt > 1: the number of new infections increases R t = 1: the number of new infections remains the same R t <1: the number of new infections decreases

As the COVID-19 pandemic already continuing in Bangladesh, despite no nation-wide lockdown in place, schools, college, universities remained close till now, it is important to watch daily Rt for Bangladesh to set up comprehensive strategies by policy-makers.

Reamarks:
Bangladesh has seen three waves of COVID-19 so far. An upheaveal of Rt in March  and May 2021 is due to Uk and Delta variant , respectively.



Spatial cluserting of Rt in Bangladesh.
Since local data is avilable upto 15 December 2020, k-means cluserting was employed on the data.Before clustering Moran's I has been computed.
